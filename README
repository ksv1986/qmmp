Attention! Qmmp build needs lrelease installed. The qt4-linguist package often contains this utility.

Configure:
cmake ./

Build:
make

Installation:
make install

If someone module (for example, Jack plugin) doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it
by running:
cmake ./ -D USE_JACK:BOOL=FALSE

Available options:
USE_MAD, USE_FLAC, USE_VORBIS, USE_MPC, USE_MODPLUG, USE_SNDFILE, USE_WAVPACK, USE_FFMPEG, USE_AAC,
USE_CUE, USE_MPLAYER, USE_CDA, USE_ALSA, USE_OSS, USE_JACK, USE_PULSE, USE_SRC, USE_ANALYZER, USE_MPRIS,
USE_SCROBBLER, USE_STATICON, USE_NOTIFIER, USE_LYRICS, USE_HAL, USE_QMMP_DIALOG

Also you can use ccmake for changing plugins configuration.
By default program will be installed in /usr/local. You can change default path by running:
cmake ./ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=custom_path

In some cases, you can use qmake for building and installation.

Configure:
qmake-qt4 (or qmake)

Build:
make

Installation:
make install INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local

Executable:
./bin/qmmp

If someone module doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it
in qmmp.pri file - just comment corresponding line( symbol '#').
Attention! By default all modules are enabled.

Changing shared library install path (needed by some 64-bit distributions).
By default, all libraries and plugins will be installed to $(INSTALL PREFIX)/lib. You can change "lib" 
to "lib64" by running qmake-qt4 or cmake with special parameter:
qmake-qt4 LIB_DIR=/lib64
or
cmake ./ -D LIB_DIR=lib64
