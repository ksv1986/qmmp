This is simple example of File Dialog plugin.
Requires Qt3Support library. This plugin developed 
mostly for QMMP customizing demonstration - 
we don't think that somebody will prefer use Qt3
look&feel :)

Build: Change QMMPROOT variable in .pro file according your 
QMMP build tree location.Then  qmake && make

Install: copy library into ~/.qmmp/plugins/FileDialogs directory.
